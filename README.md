# Personal Portfolio Website

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my personal portfolio website that I built as part of my SWE 363 course at KFUPM. It's a clean, responsive site showcasing who I am, what I do, and how to get in touch with me.

## What's This About?

I created this portfolio to have a professional online presence where I can showcase my projects, research work, and basically give people a good sense of who I am as a computer science student and aspiring AI researcher. The site has a modern look with both light and dark themes (because let's be honest, dark mode is just better ðŸ˜Ž).

## Features

- **Responsive design** - Works great on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Dark/Light theme toggle** - Switch between themes with the click of a button
- **Smooth animations** - Fade-in effects and smooth scrolling for a polished feel
- **Interactive elements** - Hover effects, form validation, and mobile menu
- **Time-based greeting** - The hero section greets you based on the time of day
- **Typewriter effect** - Cool typing animation for the subtitle

## What's Inside

The portfolio includes several sections:

- **Hero Section** - Introduction with a time-based greeting
- **About Me** - My background, education, and what I'm passionate about
- **Projects** - Showcase of my key projects including AI research work
- **Contact** - Get in touch form (currently frontend-only)

## Tech Stack

I kept it simple but modern:
- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** with Grid and Flexbox for styling
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity
- **Google Fonts** (Inter) for typography
- **Git** for version control

## How to Run This Locally

Pretty straightforward - since it's a static site:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A1maan/assignment-1.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd assignment-1
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser, or if you want to use a local server:
   ```bash
   # If you have Python installed
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Or if you have Node.js
   npx serve .
   ```

4. That's it! The site should be running locally.

## AI Integration

I used several AI tools while building this site, mainly GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT for:
- Code suggestions and completion
- Debugging help when things weren't working
- CSS styling ideas
- Documentation improvements

You can check out the detailed AI usage report in `docs/ai-usage-report.md` to see exactly how I leveraged these tools while making sure I understood everything I implemented.

## What I Learned

This project was a great refresher on web fundamentals. Some key takeaways:

- **CSS Grid and Flexbox** are incredibly powerful for layouts
- **Vanilla JavaScript** can do a lot without needing frameworks
- **Responsive design** requires thinking mobile-first
- **AI tools** are amazing assistants but you still need to understand the code
- **Good documentation** takes time but it's totally worth it

## Future Plans

I'm planning to expand this portfolio as I progress through my studies:
- Add a proper backend for the contact form
- Include more projects as I build them
- Maybe add a blog section for my research
- Optimize performance even further
- Add some cool animations with CSS or maybe Three.js
